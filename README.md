# GetCleanDataPjt
Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This project creates one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The following are the important files in this github repository:
1) run_analysis.R : script to execute objectives from the project
2) README.md : to explain the files in this repository
3) tidydata.txt : a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
3) Codebook.md : to explain the variable names in tidydata.txt

The data for the project can be found here:
